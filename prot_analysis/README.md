## Directories Description

data_input - directory with input files, such as the AB classification, predicted data, and the protein list.

data_output - directory with output files containing data that encompass more than one protein (note that each protein has its directory with specific data about itself), such as the protein euclidean distance of all proteins in ascending order, table of affinity hydrophilic, table of difference threshold distance and the contacts predicted, the f1-score calculated with the scores obtained in the Dists_x_Score.csv table, statistics of the proteins, etc....

src - directory with the analysis software, such as the script that converts amino acid sequence to the AB sequence  and extract data for the others (pdb3.py), the program that calculate the global statistics (calc_statistics.py), the script that create the tables of the statistics (ver_pos_score.py), and the software that create 3d model from the PDB file (create_3d_model.py).

proteins - directory with all proteins data generated by the programs, such as the alpha carbon coordinates information, the euclidean distances between the alpha carbons, the CIF file containing the informations about the protein, the hydrophobic position of the alpha carbons, coordinates of the 3D model, AB sequence of the protein, all atoms coordinates of the PDB file, euclidean distances map showing which distances are for each pair of atoms, etc....

docs - directory with a step-by-step manual for the new users.

*the root directory contains shellscript to run the programs. 

	$ ./exec.sh               	# Execute all the programs, getting the data and processing;

	$ ./exec_pdb3.sh               	# Get the protein and its data;

	$ ./exec_calc_statistcs.sh      # Process the data and get global statistics; 

	$ ./exec_ver_pos_score.sh       # Create the .csv to help vizualizate the data.	

	$ ./exec_create_3d_model.sh     # Create a file for each protein containing coordinates of the 3d model.
